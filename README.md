Hi, this is a program that you will maybe use in the future, it works very simply. First of all it needs bloomberg open, and for you to install the associated packages by running (pip install pandas blpapi numpy openai requests). The program uses bloomberg data to fetch prices and uses data.csv to fetch the portfolio (do not change the format of the data.csv file, simply add positions with their associated ticker and the program should be able to understand their relative weights and be able to timescale before and after the date of the portfolio). The program works by fetching each position in the portfolio and then links to my ben.rudin@endgamecap.com email in order to search the mail for relevant headlines for each position using AI. Then it spits out a report. It will not be able to give headlines to correspond with old headlines not in the inbox so this tool is likely for the future.
